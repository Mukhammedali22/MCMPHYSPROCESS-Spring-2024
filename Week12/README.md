We've made it to this point!
Solving the Navier-Stokes equation using the explicit method and the Jacobi method. All the types of equations and numerical methods we've covered over these 11 weeks are now being applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equation. You've done an incredible job and should be proud of your achievements!

Next week, we will review all the methods we've studied and see how they can solve the Navier-Stokes equation. This will help solidify your knowledge and show how different approaches can solve complex problems in computational fluid dynamics.

Additionally, there is a PDF document included here that provides a detailed explanation of the solution methods. I highly recommend you review it first.

By the way here is the visualization of the solution:
