Solving the Navier-Stokes Equation

We've made it to this point!
Solving the Navier-Stokes equation using the explicit method and the Jacobi method. All the types of equations and numerical methods we've covered over these 11 weeks are now being applied to solve the Navier-Stokes equation. You've done an incredible job and should be proud of your achievements!

Next week, we will review all the methods we've studied and assess their applicability to the Navier-Stokes equation. This will be a great opportunity to solidify your knowledge and see how different approaches can be used to solve complex problems in computational fluid dynamics.

By the way here is the visualization of the solution:
