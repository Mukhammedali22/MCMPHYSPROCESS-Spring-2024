# Fundamentals of Mathematical and Computer Modeling of Natural Physical Processes

## Introduction

Welcome to the README section. This repository contains a comprehensive overview of equations, ranging from simple one-dimensional Heat, Poisson, Laplace and Transport equations to more complex two-dimensional and three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.

## Course Content

This course, titled **"Fundamentals of Mathematical and Computer Modeling of Natural Physical Processes"**,  is offered by KBTU University and primarily focuses on solving various types of equations, including:

- **1D, 2D, and 3D Heat Equations**
- **1D, 2D, and 3D Laplace Equations**
- **1D, 2D, and 3D Poisson Equations**
- **1D Transport Equation**
- **2D Burger's Equation**
- **2D Navier-Stokes Equation**

The course covers a variety of implicit methods, including:

- **Thomas Algorithm**
- **Tridiagonal Matrix Method**
- **Fractional Step Method (FSM)**
- **Alternating Direction Method (ADM)**

In addition, it also covers several explicit methods:

- **Explicit Scheme**
- **Jacobi Method**
- **Gauss-Seidel Method**
- **Upper Relaxation Method**

To solve the Navier-Stokes equation, the method of splitting by physical parameters has been utilized.

## Programming Languages

The implementations are done using **Python** and **C++**.

## Purpose
